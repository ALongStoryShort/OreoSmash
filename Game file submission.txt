Status of Implementation: 
We have created a artistic scene for our gameplay to take place. Scripts and sound have been uploaded to unity, they just have to be connected.

 Written follow up: 

 The biggest challenge for this project?
Our biggest challenge for this project has been that we have had issues with sprites and many of our objectives overlapped.

 Do you agree with the roles you group selected or what changes would you make?
I do agree with the roles our group selected because I think each person was well suited for each job and did the best they could in completing each of their tasks. The only changes I would make would be to have a larger group.
 What did you learn about your particular role?
I learned how even a single detail, no matter how small can make or break a project such as this.
If you had to teach someone version control what tips would you give?
Take helpful notes and stay calm. It does not help you to get stressed.
